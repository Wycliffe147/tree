    At her home a girl lived
    <br>Hopless and lost  she alwalys grieved
    <br>For truth be told 
    <br>Like evryone else  
    <br>She had a soul
    <br>Only that hers 
    <br>was not as it was  
    <br>When God gave it whole
    <br>
    <br>She used to ponder the earth
    <br>Living her life to the fullest 
    <br>For what use is life
    <br>If you don't live it?
    <br>There is need to enjoy 
    <br>all its pleasure
    <br>Before we drop down <i>kulichete</i>
    <br>Life is meant to be lived  
    <br>This she trully believed
    <br>With a hie from sin to sinness
    <br>.....A morning to prayer procastination
    <br>.....An afternoon to eating weakness
    <br>.....And night of bad imagination
    <br>
    <br>Was there no hope 
    <br>For this lost soul?
    <br>A whole troupe 
    <br>thought so
    <br>But the way maker 
    <br>Made a way
    <br>A way out of this soul's slavery
    <br>
    <br>The way maker 
    <br>Made a route on the river Jordan
    <br>For this girl to cross.
    <br>The route led her to a Jericho
    <br>A Jericho called Life
    <br>A Jericho for her to conqure 
    <br>And conqure it she did
    <br>With a hie from Faith to Faith 
    <br>.....A morning to praying devotion
    <br>.....An afternoon to fasting bread
    <br>.....And night of devine communication   
    <br>
    <br>Now the girl went back home
    <br>But her past was dead 
    <br>For a new dawn rose through
    <br>And her name was you.
